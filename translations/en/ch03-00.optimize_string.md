# string

Before moving on to perfecting our interpreter, this chapter pauses to discuss the string type in Lua in detail. In a high-level language like Lua, strings are an easy type to use; but in a low-level language like Rust, strings are not so simple. Here is a passage from ["Rust Programming Language"](https://kaisery.github.io/trpl-zh-cn/ch08-02-strings.html):

> Strings are an area where new Rustaceans usually get stuck, for a combination of three reasons: Rust tends to ensure that possible bugs are exposed, and strings are more complex than many programmers think Data structures, and UTF-8. All of these elements combined can appear difficult to programmers from other language backgrounds.

Implementing and optimizing strings in the Lua interpreter is a great opportunity to explore Rust strings.

Based on the definition of string, this chapter will also make an important decision: [use `Rc` to implement garbage collection](./ch03-05.rc-vs-gc).
