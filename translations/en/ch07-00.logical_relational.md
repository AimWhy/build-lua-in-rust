# Logical and Relational Operations

This chapter introduces logical operations and relational operations. Both types of operations have two application scenarios: conditional judgment and evaluation. For example the following code:

```lua
-- logic operation
if a and b then -- conditional judgment
     print(t.k or 0) -- evaluate
end

-- Relational operations
if a > b then -- conditional judgment
     print(c > d) -- evaluate
end

-- Combination of logical operations and relational operations
if a > b and c < d then -- conditional judgment
     print (x > 0 and x or -x) -- evaluate
end
```

The analysis methods in these two scenarios are slightly different. Generally speaking, conditional judgments occur more often than evaluations, so when introducing these two types of operations in this chapter, we first introduce the parsing in conditional judgment scenarios and optimize them; then complete the evaluation scenario.

The scene of conditional judgment is derived from the control structure in the previous chapter, which is why these two types of operations are not introduced immediately after arithmetic operations in Chapter 5, but must be introduced after the control structure.
