# `elseif` and `else` branches

The previous section supported the `if` statement. This section continues with the `elseif` and `else` branches.

The complete BNF specification is as follows:

```
     if exp then block {else if exp then block} [else block] end
```

In addition to the if judgment, there can also be multiple optional elseif judgment branches in a row, followed by an optional else branch at the end. The control structure diagram is as follows:

```
     +-------------------+
     | if condition then |-------\ jump to the next `elseif` branch if $condition is false
     +-------------------+       |
                                 |
         block                   |
/<----                           |
|    +-----------------------+<--/
|    | elseif condition then |-----\ jump to the next `elseif` branch if $condition is false
|    +-----------------------+     |
|                                  |
|        block                     |
+<----                             |
|    +-----------------------+<----/
|    | elseif condition then |-------\ jump to the `else` branch if $condition is false
|    +-----------------------+       |
|                                    |
|        block                       |
+<----                               |
|    +------+                        |
|    | else |                        |
|    +------+<-----------------------/
|
|        block
|
|    +-----+
|    | end |
|    +-----+
\---> All block jump here.
      The last block gets here without jump.
```

The above diagram depicts the situation where there are 2 `elseif` branches and 1 `else` branch. Except for the judgment jump of `if` in the upper right corner, the rest are jumps to be added. There are 2 types of jumps:

- The conditional jump on the right side of the figure is executed by the `Test` bytecode added in the previous section;
- The unconditional jump on the left side of the figure needs to add `Jump` bytecode, which is defined as follows:

```rust, ignore
pub enum ByteCode {
     // condition structures
     Test(u8, u16),
     Jump(u16),
```

The syntax analysis process is as follows:

- For the `if` judgment branch, compared with the previous section, the position of the conditional jump remains unchanged, and it is still the end position of the block; however, an unconditional jump instruction needs to be added at the end of the block to jump to the end of the entire if statement;

- For the `elseif` branch, it is handled in the same way as the `if` branch.

- For the `else` branch, no processing is required.

The format of the final generated bytecode sequence should be as follows, where `...` represents the bytecode sequence of the inner code block:

```
     Test --\  `if` branch
     ...    |
/<-- Jump   |
|      /<---/
|    Test ----\  `elseif` branch
|    ...      |
+<-- Jump     |
|      /<-----/
|    Test ------\  `elseif` branch
|    ...        |
+<-- Jump       |
|      /<-------/
|    ...   `else` branch
|
\--> end of all

```

The syntax analysis code is as follows:

```rust, ignore
     fn if_stat(&mut self) {
         let mut jmp_ends = Vec::new();

         // `if` branch
         let mut end_token = self. do_if_block(&mut jmp_ends);

         // optional multiple `elseif` branches
         while end_token == Token::Elseif { // If the previous block ends with the keyword `elseif`
             end_token = self.do_if_block(&mut jmp_ends);
         }

         // optional `else` branch
         if end_token == Token::Else { // If the previous block ends with the keyword `else`
             end_token = self. block();
         }

         assert_eq!(end_token, Token::End); // Syntax: `end` at the end

         // Repair the unconditional jump bytecode at the end of the 
         // block in all `if` and `elseif` branches, and jump to the
         // current position
         let iend = self.byte_codes.len() - 1;
         for i in jmp_ends.into_iter() {
             self.byte_codes[i] = ByteCode::Jump((iend - i) as i16);
         }
     }
```

The processing function `do_if_block()` for if and elseif is as follows:

```rust, ignore
     fn do_if_block(&mut self, jmp_ends: &mut Vec<usize>) -> Token {
         let icond = self.exp_discharge_top(); // read judgment statement
         self.lex.expect(Token::Then); // Syntax: `then` keyword

         self.byte_codes.push(ByteCode::Test(0, 0)); // generate Test bytecode placeholder, leave the parameter blank
         let itest = self.byte_codes.len() - 1;

         let end_token = self. block();

         // If there is an `elseif` or `else` branch, then the current
         // block needs to add an unconditional jump bytecode, to jump
         // to the end of the entire `if` statement. Since the position
         // of the end is not known yet, the parameter is left blank and the
         // The bytecode index is recorded into `jmp_ends`.
         // No need to jump if there are no other branches.
         if matches!(end_token, Token::Elseif | Token::Else) {
             self.byte_codes.push(ByteCode::Jump(0));
             jmp_ends.push(self.byte_codes.len() - 1);
         }

         // Fix the previous Test bytecode.
         // `iend` is the current position of the bytecode sequence,
         // `itest` is the position of the Test bytecode, and the difference
         // between the two is the number of bytecodes that need to be jumped.
         let iend = self.byte_codes.len() - 1;
         self.byte_codes[itest] = ByteCode::Test(icond as u8, (iend - itest) as i16);

         return end_token;
     }
```

## Virtual Machine Execution

The implementation of the newly added unconditional jump bytecode `Jump` is very simple. Compared with the previous conditional jump bytecode `Test`, only the conditional judgment is removed:

```rust, ignore
                 // conditional jump
                 ByteCode::Test(icond, jmp) => {
                     let cond = &self. stack[icond as usize];
                     if matches!(cond, Value::Nil | Value::Boolean(false)) {
                         pc += jmp as usize; // jump if false
                     }
                 }

                 // unconditional jump
                 ByteCode::Jump(jmp) => {
                     pc += jmp as usize;
                 }
```
