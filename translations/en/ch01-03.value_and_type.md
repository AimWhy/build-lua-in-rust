# value and type

The previous section defined the bytecode, and mentioned at the end that we need two tables, the constant table and the global variable table, respectively to maintain the relationship between constants and variables and "values", so its definition depends on the Lua value definition. This section introduces and defines Lua values.

For the convenience of description, all the words "variable" in this section later include variables and constants.

Lua is a dynamically typed language, and the "type" is bound to a value, not to a variable. For example, in the first line of the following code, the information contained in the variable n before the equal sign is: "the name is n"; the information contained after the equal sign is: "the type is an integer" and "the value is 10". So in line 2, n can still be assigned a string value.

```lua
local n = 10
n = "hello" -- OK
```

For comparison, here's the statically typed language Rust. In the first line, the information before the equal sign is: "the name is n" and "the type is i32"; the information after the equal sign is: "the value is 10". It can be seen that the "type" information has changed from the attribute of the variable to the attribute of the value. So you can't assign n to a string value later.

```rust, ignore
let mut n: i32 = 10;
n = "hello"; // !!! Wrong
```

The following two diagrams represent the relationship between variables, values, and types in dynamically typed and statically typed languages, respectively:

```
     variable value variable value
   +--------+ +----------+ +----------+ +----------+
   | Name: n |--\------>| Type: Integer | | Name: n |-------->| Value: 10 |
   +--------+ | | Value: 10 | | Type: Integer | | +---------+
               | +----------+ +----------+ X
               | |
               | +------------+ | +------------+
               \------>| Type: String | \--->| Value: "hello" |
                       | Value: "hello" | +------------+
                       +------------+

             dynamic type static type
           Types are bound to values Types are bound to variables
```

## ValueValue

In summary, the value of Lua contains type information. This is also very suitable for defining with enum:

```rust, ignore
{{#include ../listing/ch01.hello_world/src/value.rs}}
```

Currently 3 types are defined:

- `Nil`, Lua's null value.
- `String` for the `hello, world!` string. For the associated value type, the simplest String is temporarily used, and it will be optimized later.
- `Function` for `print`. The associated function type definition refers to the C API function definition `typedef int (*lua_CFunction) (lua_State *L);` in Lua, and will be improved later. Among them, `ExeState` corresponds to `lua_State`, which will be introduced in the next section.

It is foreseeable that integers, floating-point numbers, tables and other types will be added in the future.

Above the Value definition, the `Clone` trait is implemented via `#[derive(Clone)]`. This is because Value will definitely involve assignment operations, and the String type we are defining now includes Rust's string `String`, which is [does not support direct copying](https://kaisery.github.io/trpl -zh-cn/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#%E5%86%85%E5%AD%98%E4%B8%8E%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D), namely The `Copy` trait is not implemented, or it owns the data on the heap. So we can only declare the whole Value as `Clone`. All subsequent assignments involving Value need to be implemented through `clone()`. It seems that the performance is worse than direct assignment. We will discuss this issue later when we define more types.

We also manually implemented the `Debug` trait to define the print format, after all, the function of the current object code is to print "hello, world!". Since the function pointer parameter associated with `Function` does not support the `Debug` trait, it cannot be automatically implemented by `#[derive(Debug)]`.

## two tables

After defining the value Value, you can define the two tables mentioned at the end of the previous section.

Constant table, used to store all the required constants. The bytecode refers to constants directly by index, so constant tables can be represented by Rust's variable-length array `Vec<Value>`.

The global variable table, which stores global variables according to their names, can *temporarily* be represented by Rust's `HashMap<String, Value>`.

> Compared with the ancient C language, components such as `Vec` and `HashMap` in the Rust standard library have brought great convenience. Instead of inventing your own wheels, provide a consistent experience.
