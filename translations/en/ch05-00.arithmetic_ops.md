# Numerical operations

Supported operations are described in the [Lua Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#3.4.1). This chapter mainly discusses and implements numerical operations and bit operations, and also implements string concatenation operations and length operations by the way. These operations are handled in the same way. As for relational operations and logical operations, special processing needs to be done after conditional statements are introduced.

Simple unary operations are introduced first, then binary operations, and finally floating-point conversions.
