# Arithmetic Operations

Supported operations are described in the [Lua Manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#3.4.1). This chapter mainly discusses and implements arithmetic operations and bit operations, and also implements string concatenation operations and length operations by the way. These operations are handled in the same way. As for relational operations and logical operations, special processing needs to be done after conditional statements are introduced.

Simple unary operations are introduced first, then binary operations. Finally we discuss the floating-point conversions.
