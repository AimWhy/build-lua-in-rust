# control structure

This chapter introduces the control structure. The most obvious change is that since then, the virtual machine no longer only executes sequentially, but jumps. And because the parsing of the syntax block is called recursively during syntax analysis, the local variable scope needs to be dealt with, which makes the meaning and boundary of the block clearer.

Several control structures in Lua language are very common, similar to other languages, nothing special. Next, the first section first introduces the if branch of the simplest if statement, and introduces conditional jumps and block processing. Then introduce other control structures in turn, most of which are implemented through conditional jumps (Test bytecode) and unconditional jumps (Jump bytecode). Only the numeric for statement uses 2 special bytecodes for performance considerations due to its complex semantics. The generic for statement needs to use functions, so it will be introduced after introducing functions in subsequent chapters.

In addition, this chapter also discusses and attempts to introduce the continue statement that does not exist in Lua, and guarantees backward compatibility.

In addition, although this chapter fully implements each control structure functionally, the implementation here will be optimized after the introduction of relational and logical operations in the next chapter.
