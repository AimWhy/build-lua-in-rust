# Closure Closure

The previous chapter introduced functions, and all functions in the Lua language are actually closures. This chapter introduces closures.

The so-called closure is the function prototype associated with some variables. In Lua, these associated variables are called Upvalue. If you understand closures in Rust, then according to ["Rust Programming Language"](https://kaisery.github.io/trpl-zh-cn/ch13-01-closures.html) it is "capturing "Environment" means the same thing as "associated variable". So Upvalue is fundamental to understanding and implementing closures.

The next section 1 of this chapter introduces the most basic concept of Upvalue; the following sections 2 and 3 introduce the important feature of Upvalue, escape, which is what makes the closure really powerful; Section 4 introduces the Rust closure corresponding to the Rust function . The following sections 5 and 6 are the two application scenarios of closure and Upvalue respectively.
